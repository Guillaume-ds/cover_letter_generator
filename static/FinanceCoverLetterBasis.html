			Position : internship as {position:}			
		</p>
		<p>
			Dear Sir or Madam,
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently enrolled in the joined MSc Data Science for Business at HEC Paris and Polytechnique, I am eagerly 
			seeking to apply to your internship program as {position:} in Paris, starting in March 2023.
		</p>
		<p>
			{companyName:}, as one of the leader on the market, embodies a challenging working environment to me. I want to 
			benefit from the experience of the traders and the data scientists with whom I will be working in order to develop
			an expertise in both of those fields. The technical skills required are a proof of the excellence of the company and 
			give me the confidence that I will be able to make significant progress over the course of my internship. 
			Moreover, my profound interest in both data science and finance lead me to believe that I could fit {companyName:} 
			requirements as {position:}.
		</p>
		<p>	
			During my previous experience, both as a data analyst and a python developer at Polyconseil, I have 
			been able to work with large amount of data and deepen my knowldege in data science. I single-handedly 
			developed an interactive dashboard connected to a predictive algorithm in order to facilitate the use of 
			data by the business teams. I am convinced that the skillset I developed will prove to be useful for the 
			development of data-driven applications for finance.
		</p>
		<p>	
			My second internship, as a consultant and javascript developer at Wavestone, allowed me to experience 
			the digital transition at a large scale. I was part of the developpement team of a staffing software and
			I faced the challenge of creating a software for a multi-disciplinary team. I am confident that the knowldege
			I gained at this occasion will allow me to exerce a critical approach during the conception of financial tools
			intended for various teams.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Those two experiences helped me develop {skillsRequired:}. I hope that I will have the chance to apply those 
			skills as {position:} at {companyName:} while I {description:}.
		</p>
		<p>
			Given my interests, the skills I have developed through my past experiences, and my determination, I would be 
			thrilled to contribute to your firm. I hope to further discuss my application with your teams and I am looking 
			forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yours sincerely,<br><br>
			Guillaume de Surville
